      <h2>My Review</h2>
      <p>
        This film stars Adam Driver as a pilot who crash-lands on an unknown planet that turns out to be Earth 65 million years ago, where everyone on the ship dies but one young woman. Adam Driver has to team up with this young woman to survive and escape the planet before it gets destroyed. The movie received many mixed reviews but in my opinion, it was pretty good. I thought the visual effects were great but it did lack a bit in the plot of the movie. Overall it is a good watch.

      <h2>Other Reviews</h2>
      <p>"The Adam Driver-starring thriller is a lean, mean exercise in sci-fi suspense set far in our planetary past (if only by sheer misadventure)." - Jeff Ewing (Inverse)</p>
      <p>"Driver gives a Driver-level performance and it’s a tight 90 minutes. And those two aspects alone are enough for a passable dino actioner." - Wenlei Ma (News.com.au)</p>
      <p>"65 is essentially a big-budget version of a simple, made-for-streaming creature feature, nothing more and nothing less." - Dylan Roth (Observer)</p>
      <p>"The premise doesn't hold up to close scrutiny and the narrative can be jarringly slow-paced." - Linda Marric (New Scientist)</p>
