      <h2>My Review</h2>
      <p>
        This awesome movie was an enchanting introduction to the magical world of Harry Potter. The movie has such a strong cast that works so well together and they bring a genuine sense of wonder, friendship, and courage to their roles, making it easy so easy for us as viewers to connect with them. The film makes you love the characters so much and it sets the stage for the rest of the movies.
