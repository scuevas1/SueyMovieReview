      <h2>My Review</h2>
      <p>
        This movie has been such a great change in pace for Marvel movies since Avengers: endgame. In the film, the Guardians must face off against a new threat while also dealing with the fallout from the events of Avengers: endgame. The movie focuses a lot on Rocket’s difficult life and it's pretty heavy. The film deals with some heavy themes, such as grief, loss, and redemption, but it does so in a way that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The movie is very funny and has a great soundtrack. Great movie!

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team to defend the universe and protect one of their own. If the mission is not completely successful, it could possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know.
